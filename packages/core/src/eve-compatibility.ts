  // A contiguous two-line window: 0.69.0 (published 2026-10-01) entered on
  // 2026-10-02 and 0.62 retired with it. 0.68 stays because Eveland v0.60.0,
  // the first release past the {0.58, 0.62} window, ships it; 0.63 through
  // 0.67 never reached a release. 0.62's Releases now answer 409 on
  // activation and their parked runs are settled, as 0.58's did when it
  // retired on 2026-09-23. Everything the window kept for 0.62 alone is gone
  // with it: the object-form sandbox backend module (every line builds a
  // provider environment since 0.64), the scheduler's `mode: "task"` line
  // (0.67 removed the run mode), and the `taskRunWorkflow` audit entry.
  //
  // 0.69 is the largest protocol move since 0.31. Background tasks are gone:
  // every workflow tool and agent call blocks its turn until it settles, the
  // `subagent.*` stream events and hooks are replaced by `task.started`,
  // `task.settled`, and `agent.started`, a call's receipt is plain text, and
  // a question raised inside a running call parks the turn with
  // `turn.waiting` instead of ending it. The message stream moves to v26
  // (the 0.69 client still reads v21-v25, so one Dashboard client serves
  // both lines), the session checkpoint to 10 (eve rejects a handoff across
  // the boundary; Eveland pins each session to its Deployment and never
  // hands off), and every extension contract family drops its 0.68 epochs.
  // The discovery manifest (v15), the route set Eveland forwards, the
  // bundled Workflow runtime, and the sandbox provider API are unchanged.
